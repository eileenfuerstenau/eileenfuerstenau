### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

-  :briefcase: I used to be a sales manager in the IT industry. 
- ðŸŒ± Until i decided that I would like to create digital products myself. 
- :mortar_board: I've completed the neue fische Web Development Bootcamp to learn all the necessary basics.
- :tada: With basic knowlege about p.e. Git, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, node.js, Express, MongoDB, PHP and Component Testing I was able to create my very first own Web App called "ReadSocial".
- ðŸ’¬ Now I would love to deepen my knowledge and learn more.
